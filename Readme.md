### Work in progress startup patterns

- RxUI navigating and loading patterns aren't fully baked and this is me just messing around with some ideas
of serializing Vms. It just gets weird in some cases like with Android how activities destroy but things stay in memory. So need
to differentiate between that type of resume vs colde resume.
